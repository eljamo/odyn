# The NESTED layout (Settings → Appearance → Worktree layout → nested) on the README's orbit-api
# project: three worktrees, each a header over its cards along a rail. `main` holds a running
# session and a terminal; feat/auth-tokens a pull request that is ready, the checkout's changes
# counted beside it, and a session stopped on a permission prompt; fix/rate-limits a pull request
# that has merged and a session that finished unread — the one-line card a finished session
# recedes to. The preset is ODYN_SHOT_THEME (`default` when unset), the pane beside the cards
# unless ODYN_SHOT_PANE says `bottom`.
